# CoffeeShops
creating CoffeeShops App
CoffeeSwift App

ABSTRACT:

The app monitors users location in a 500 by 500 meter region, and fetches venue data from Foursquare and lists the coffee shops nearby. We are using a MKMapView to locate the coffeeshop on Mapview and also use UITableView to list the coffee shop details. Here we are using CocoaPods in our project. 
Weâ€™ll use 2 external libraries for this project: Realm and Das Quadrant, a Swift library for the Foursquare REST API.

Prerequisites:

We need to install cocoa pods by typing following in the terminal:

$pod install
